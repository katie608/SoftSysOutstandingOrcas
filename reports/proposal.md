# Learning C++ Game Design
### Katie Foster, Shirin Kuppusamy, Mahima Beltur

We will be doing a series of C++ game design tutorials in order to one, better learn the C++ language, and two, to learn how to apply C++ to game design. At a bare minimum, we intend on completing all the tutorials we identify as important. As a stretch goal, we will attempt to collaboratively create a short game based on what we learned from the tutorial. 

In order to get started, we will need a list of tutorials that we deem as valuable to our learning and all-encompassing. We have not decided upon tutorials yet, but we have set a meeting to narrow down which tutorials we will complete. Our first step is to each find three tutorials that we consider useful or interesting that we will bring to our meeting. We will then decide between these 9 which ones we will do and create a timeline for completing these tutorials. We will meet once a week to check-in on progress and resolve questions.
