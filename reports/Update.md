#Learning C++ Game Design
##Katie Foster, Shirin Kuppusamy, Mahima Beltur

We are working on doing a series of C++ game design tutorials in order to meet our learning goals of becoming familiar with C++ and how to apply C++ to game design. After encountering difficulties with the first tutorial that we selected, we have altered our learning goal to encompass learning C++ in Linux, ideally without the use of Visual Studio. At a bare minimum, we intend on completing all the tutorials we have identified as important. As a stretch goal, we will attempt to collaboratively create a short game based on what we learned from the tutorials.
Thus far, we have found a list of tutorials and narrowed it down to useful and applicable ones. We first attempted a tutorial that used visual studio, but werenâ€™t able to progress far. After struggling to get the code working for 1-2 hours each, we decided that our struggling was not adding to our learning. As a result, we decided to go directly to the website for the library that the original tutorial used, and follow their tutorials. There are fewer resources for C++ game design without visual studio, but we would rather struggle with coding problems than with trying to get Visual Studio to work. Thus, we are now following these tutorials:

Currently, we are each responsible for completing an hour of either of the above tutorials by our next meeting (with a goal of having at least one tangible output). We also are each responsible for reviewing what we did well enough to be able to share knowledge during our next meeting with the other teammates. We are all progressively working on brainstorming ideas that we enjoy working on, yet find challenging enough, from the tutorials to work on for a game once we feel we have a solid understanding of the tutorials. We will continue to meet once a week to check-in on progress and resolve questions.
